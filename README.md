## getting started

currently this is still a work-in-progress. to see what's working so far, after cloning the repo:

```sh
npm install
cd examples
npm install
npm setup
```

the setup script will

- prompt for questions and generate a .env file
- start postgres in a docker container
- run migrations using graphile-migrate
- run the sourcerer plugins in the config file

## plugins

currently there are a few core plugins:

- `makeTypesPlugin` - generates type aliases
